## Background
This is a mini game I built for my son to help him improve this memory and focus. 

## Installation
- `npm install` to install all the dependecies
- `npm run dev` to run the app in development mode
- `npm run build` to build app for production

## About the template
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
